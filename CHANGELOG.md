# Changelog System Documentation

## Overview

The changelog system provides automatic popup notifications for new versions and a comprehensive version history viewer. It tracks user interactions to show the changelog popup only once per version.

## Components

### 1. Changelog Service (`lib/changelog-service.ts`)
- Manages version data loading from `public/changelog.json`
- Handles version comparison logic
- Manages localStorage for tracking user's last seen version
- Provides utilities for date formatting and version badges

### 2. Changelog Popup (`components/changelog-popup.tsx`)
- Shows on app load if a new version is available
- Displays version information with appropriate icons and styling
- Marks version as seen when dismissed
- ChangelogManager component handles the popup lifecycle

### 3. Changelog Viewer (`components/changelog-viewer.tsx`)
- Full changelog display for the About page
- Expandable version entries with detailed change information
- Responsive design with version badges and dates
- Auto-expands the latest version

### 4. Changelog Tester (`components/changelog-tester.tsx`)
- Development-only testing component
- Allows clearing localStorage to test popup behavior
- Runs comprehensive tests on the changelog system

## Data Structure

The changelog data is stored in `public/changelog.json`:

```json
{
  "latest": "1.2.0",
  "versions": {
    "1.2.0": {
      "version": "1.2.0",
      "date": "2024-08-29",
      "title": "Bug Fixes & Stability Improvements",
      "changes": [
        "Fixed TypeScript errors across all components",
        "Resolved color styling type issues",
        "Updated crypto API usage to modern secure methods"
      ],
      "type": "patch",
      "important": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Version Types

- **major**: Breaking changes or significant new features
- **minor**: New features without breaking changes
- **patch**: Bug fixes and small improvements

## Integration

The changelog system is integrated into the app at several points:

1. **Main Layout**: ChangelogManager wraps the app to show popups
2. **About Page**: ChangelogViewer displays full changelog
3. **Dynamic Island**: About tab includes changelog section

## Updating the Changelog

### Manual Update
Edit `public/changelog.json` directly and update the `latest` field.

### Automated Update
Use the provided script:

```bash
node scripts/update-changelog.js
```

This script:
- Increments the patch version automatically
- Uses recent git commit messages as change entries
- Updates the changelog.json file

### Adding to npm scripts
Add to `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "changelog": "node scripts/update-changelog.js"
  }
}
```

## User Experience

### First-time Users
- Will see the latest version popup on first visit
- Popup won't show again until a new version is released

### Returning Users
- Only see popups for versions they haven't seen before
- Version tracking uses localStorage with key `realtalk_last_seen_version`

### Version Viewing
- Full changelog available in About page
- Expandable entries with detailed information
- Latest version badge and highlighting

## Development

### Testing Popups
1. Go to About page in development mode
2. Use the Changelog Tester component
3. Click "Clear Last Seen" to reset localStorage
4. Refresh the page to see the popup again

### Adding New Versions
1. Update the `latest` field in changelog.json
2. Add the new version entry to the `versions` object
3. The popup will show automatically for users who haven't seen it
